Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of  lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea
It is closely related to the American lobster , H
americanus
It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws
In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking
Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into  larvae
Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles
Description
Homarus gammarus is a large  , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @
Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard  which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called  (  )
This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals
The first pair of  is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws
The larger one is the "  " , and has rounded  used for crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey
Usually , the left claw is the  , and the right is the cutter
The  is generally blue above , with spots that  , and yellow below
The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking
This occurs because , in life , the red pigment  is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment
The closest relative of H
gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus
The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap
The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics :  The  of H
americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H
gammarus
The spines on the claws of H
americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H
gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped
The underside of the claw of H
americanus is orange or red , while that of H
gammarus is creamy white or very pale red
Life cycle
Female H
gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @
@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size 
Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently  female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male
The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her
Females carrying eggs are said to be "  " and can be found throughout the year
The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on
This stage involves three  and lasts for 15 – 35 days
After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a  lifestyle
The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows
It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the  phase
When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @
@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives 
Distribution
Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea
It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea
The  populations are found in the Norwegian   and  , inside the Arctic Circle
The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment
The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster "
The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean
The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the  were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel
Attempts have been made to introduce H
gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer
Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from  in  , but the species did not become established there
Ecology
Adult H
gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 –  ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft )
They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed
The diet of H
gammarus mostly consists of other  invertebrates
These include crabs , molluscs , sea  ,  and polychaete worms
The three  lobster species Homarus gammarus , H
americanus and are hosts to the three known species of the animal   ; the species on H
gammarus has not been described
Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease  , caused by the
Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H
gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H
americanus could not be ruled out
Human consumption
Homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a  and was mentioned in " The  " a seventeenth century English folk song
It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered
Both the claws and the abdomen of H
gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible
The exceptions are the  mill and the " sand vein " ( gut )
The price of H
gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H
americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour
are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines  with  or  sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand
gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands )
The minimum landing size for H
gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @
@ 4 in ) 
systems for H
gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low
history
Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema  , published in 1758
That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans
H
gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature
Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including    , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H
Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary  , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H
Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795
The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a  selected by   in 1974
It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near  , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the  have since been lost
The common name for H
gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is " European lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster "
